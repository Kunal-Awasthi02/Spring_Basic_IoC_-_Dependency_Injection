This is a basic Strucure which shows how we can achieve the 
Inversion of Control in spring using the constructor injection
so 

There are two classes i.e are Car & Bus and one interface i.e is Vehiche

And there is a congig.xml file which is used as dependency injection
in which we write our object known as beans

So here in Class we just write the package and java file name
so to create that object

Hence we Complete the basic of Spring that is Inversion Of Control using Constructor Injection
